# I'm going to map the values from the chronogram (comparing DSCAM and mitochondrial
# branch lengths) onto the DSCAM phylogeny, then subsequently map the ancestral
# character state reconstruction on top of that in the hopes of visualizing 
# the coordination of conservation/acceleration and social structure.
