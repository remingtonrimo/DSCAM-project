Steps to make a chronogram

-Date the tree at 401 mya, available at timetree.org
	-Using the DSCAM run2
-make the chronogram, map the trees on top of each using figtree
	-using the updated parameters tree and the mitochondrion tree
	-remove species that have conflicting topology
	-each individual tree is a specific color
		dscam - red
		mitochondria - blue
-make a cophenetic heatmap
	-make a matrix of branch lengths csv
	-copy those values into a excel file and subtract those values from each other
		dscam-mitochondria
	-make the colors the same colors as the chronogram
	-combine the diagrams to make one diagram
