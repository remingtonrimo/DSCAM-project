## These are my old files from the initial submission of my manuscript
### Changes between submissions include
- including a broader range of sequences (automating data collection)
  - more DSCAM1 transcript variants
- compare DSCAM1 gene tree to prior species tree, rather than comparing it to the mitochondrial genome tree
- reconstruct exon trees & compare them to gene tree
