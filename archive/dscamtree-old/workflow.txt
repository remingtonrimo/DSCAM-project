Making a workflow for running the new phylogenetic tree using BEAST2
This is the second tree we ran.

-Used the same parameters from the defaults from BEAST1 (manually changed them to reflect that.)
##Parameters

##Site Model
#GTR + Gamma + Invariance
#Gamma catagory count=4
#Shape=0.5
#Proportional Invariant=0.5

##Clock Model
#Strict clock

##Prior Model
#Coalescent Constant Population

-Increased the generations from 2,000,000 to 50,000,000
-Used 10-25_mafft_miss-rem.nex alignment for the tree
---66 species, 4779 nucleotide positions

2. After the tree is generated run tree through tracer, and check posterior values
3. Compare node heights to mitochondrion
--make new chronogram, new heatmap, other analysis as well.
