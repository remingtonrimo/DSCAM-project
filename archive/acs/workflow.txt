This is the workflow for reconstructing the ancestral character state for sociality for arthropods. This was removed from the project due to redundancy (reconstructing sociality has already 
been done).

Reconstructing the ancestral character state using the most recent DSCAM tree. Read figure3.R for more details regarding the code.

Using the dscamrun2 file
	Create a csv file detailing the sociality trait of each species.
		name of file:
	
	Run the simulation 100 times
	Pie charts show the outcomes of the simulations ran based of the values for the tips
